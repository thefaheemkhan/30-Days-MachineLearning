# Machine Learning - (ML-101)
Machine Learning (ML101) Repository contains a one-stop solution for modern-day machine learning. 
This repo includes resources and explanations for ML algorithms and their Implementation.
Resources: Standford CS229, Hands-on Machine Learning Book, Afsine Amidi ML Cheatsheet.
This Repo is inspired from Resources like Hands-on-ML book and Standford cheatsheet by afsine amidi and CS229 by Andrew Ng.

this will continue Chapter 1 to chapter 9 from Hands-on-ML book
to be continued...

This will include 
1. Written topics and explanation docs on github
2. Notebooks notebooks and code on Google colab
3. Brief Discussion blog on medium
